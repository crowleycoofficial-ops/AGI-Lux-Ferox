## 📡 Executive Summary

**AGI-Lux-Ferox** ("Light & Ferocity") is a multi-domain open-source intelligence (OSINT) and military operations research framework. It is designed to bridge the gap between high-level strategic theory and verifiable, low-level physical data.

In an era of hybrid warfare, supply chain obfuscation, and information dominance, relying on single-source telemetry is a critical vulnerability. This repository aggregates mathematical models, simulation code (Python), and academic research (LaTeX) to provide **irrefutable, independent verification capabilities**.
